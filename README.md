# Impact of Raised Temperature Thresholds
All analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook, easily viewed on Github.
Results can be reproduced either by running the notebook locally, or by using the `analysis.py` script.

## N.B.
 - The script runs on Python 3 (with Pandas and Matplotlib).
 - Command line arguments determine whether or not the script displays Matplotlib figures during processing (`./analysis.py` runs quietly, while `./analysis.py asdf` or any other argument at all shows the plots).
